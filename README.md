Verhulst, B. (Under Review) Identifying Gene-Environment Interactions across Genome-wide, Twin, and Polygenic Risk score approaches

In the paper, we conduct a series of simualation studies to highlight the consistent ability to detecting GxE in genome-wide, twin, and polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses.

All of the simulation scripts that were used in the paper are provided, including scripts to construct the figures.
